Step 1:
Click on the fork button within the class notes repo,
Create Fork

Step 2:
Clone the file to desired location on your computer. I made an extra copy on top of my clone on my desktop for easy access for this class. 

Step 3:
Under "Branches", create a new branch and name appropriately

Step 4:
Creat a wishlist.qmd file
Add your wishes
Add to the repository

Step 5:
Within your repository there should now be an option to create pull request for your new changes.
Do that

Issues Encountered:
No real issues were encountered. I misclicked twice during file creation but it was more of an error on my end then with the directions or git. I would recommend git bash if comfortable. It made certain steps much easier.
